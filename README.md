### Hyprland dotfiles

Install with the install_parts_arch.share
    (this will copy over all the config files for this setup
    if u need only parts of it u'll have to copy them manually)


Put wallpaper and locked wallpaper image in /usr/share/nwg-hello/
and modify the path in :

    .config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf 
    .config/hypr/hyprlock.conf 
    /etc/nwg-hello/nwg-hello.css


    (or just name them the same :
